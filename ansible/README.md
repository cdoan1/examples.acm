# ansible examples

We will isolate all the ansible examples into their own "lab" folder. This will ensure that all the required artifacts are clear.
There will be a organization folder where we will combine all the roles, and show how an organization can drive using and mainting these use cases.

## table of contents

| folder | description |
|--------|-------------|
| lab-cluster-import | this example should showcase using the ansible roles to import any number of managed clusters, public and private. The example playbook allows you to run from your laptop. The python interpreter path is provided to reference the python virtual environment. |
| lab-dynamic-inventory | |
| production | gather all the examples into a single organization, this should be the active and deployed on the `playback` cluster |
